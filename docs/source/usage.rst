=====
Usage
=====

denoise provides a command-line interface for training the Noise2Inverse model and
denoising CT reconstructions.

Data preparation
================

Noise2Inverse requires **two independent sub-reconstructions** produced from
complementary angular subsets of the raw projections (even-indexed and
odd-indexed angles). These serve as training pairs: the network learns to
predict one from the other, removing noise without any clean reference images.

.. warning::

   A single full-angle reconstruction is **not sufficient** to run denoise.
   You must create the two sub-reconstructions from the raw projection data
   before proceeding.

Choosing a convolution mode
===========================

All ``denoise`` commands that touch the model accept a ``--mode`` flag:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 60 25

   * - ``--mode``
     - Description
     - Typical use
   * - ``2.5d`` *(default)*
     - 2D U-Net; stacks N adjacent slices as channels.
       Fast and memory-efficient.
     - General synchrotron CT
   * - ``3d``
     - Full 3D U-Net with skip connections; operates on cubic sub-volumes.
       Removes structured 3D noise and ring artifacts.
     - Coherent X-ray / XNH microscopy

The mode is **saved into the YAML config** at the start of training, so
you do not need to repeat ``--mode`` at inference time — the config already
knows which model type was used.  You can always override by passing
``--mode`` explicitly.

.. note::

   The ``denoise slice`` command is only available in ``--mode 2.5d``.
   In 3D mode, use ``denoise volume`` instead.

denoise prepare
---------------

Run ``denoise prepare`` (in the ``denoise`` environment) to write the
config YAML and print the two ``tomocupy recon_steps`` commands you need
to run next::

    (denoise) $ denoise prepare --file-name /data/sample.h5

This reads instrument metadata from the HDF5 file, writes
``sample_rec_config.yaml``, and prints the exact ``tomocupy recon_steps``
commands with the correct ``--out-path-name`` values.

.. note::

   ``denoise prepare`` writes the config YAML only — it does **not** create
   the sub-reconstruction directories.  Due to a NumPy compatibility issue
   between the ``denoise`` and ``tomocupy`` environments, the two
   sub-reconstructions must be created by running the printed commands
   manually in the ``tomocupy`` environment (see below).  This limitation
   will be removed once the NumPy issue is resolved.

Sub-reconstructions with tomocupy
----------------------------------

Run ``tomocupy recon_steps`` twice with the same parameters as the full
reconstruction, adding ``--start-proj``, ``--proj-step 2``, and
``--out-path-name`` to select even and odd projections respectively.
tomocupy writes output to ``<parent>_rec/`` by convention, so the
sub-reconstructions land next to the full reconstruction automatically::

    # even-indexed projections (0, 2, 4, ...)
    (tomocupy) $ tomocupy recon_steps \
                     --start-proj 0 --proj-step 2 \
                     --out-path-name /local/data/tomo_rec/sample_rec_0 \
                     [... same options as the full reconstruction ...]

    # odd-indexed projections (1, 3, 5, ...)
    (tomocupy) $ tomocupy recon_steps \
                     --start-proj 1 --proj-step 2 \
                     --out-path-name /local/data/tomo_rec/sample_rec_1 \
                     [... same options as the full reconstruction ...]

This produces::

    /local/data/tomo_rec/
        sample_rec/    ← full reconstruction (already exists)
        sample_rec_0/  ← even-angle sub-reconstruction (N2I input A)
        sample_rec_1/  ← odd-angle sub-reconstruction  (N2I input B)

.. note::

   Use **exactly the same** pre-processing options (ring removal, phase
   retrieval, normalisation, rotation axis) for both sub-reconstructions
   as for the full reconstruction.

.. note::
   **Non-tomocupy or non-APS HDF5 data**

   If your raw data is not in the standard APS HDF5 format, or you prefer a
   reconstruction tool other than tomocupy, you can create the two
   sub-reconstructions with any tool and write the config file by hand.

   **Using tomopy / dxchange** (for arbitrary data formats):

   .. code-block:: python

       import tomopy, dxchange

       proj, flat, dark, theta = dxchange.read_aps_2bm('raw_data.h5')
       proj = tomopy.normalize(proj, flat, dark)

       rec0 = tomopy.recon(proj[0::2], theta[0::2], algorithm='gridrec')
       rec1 = tomopy.recon(proj[1::2], theta[1::2], algorithm='gridrec')
       rec_full = tomopy.recon(proj, theta, algorithm='gridrec')

       dxchange.write_tiff_stack(rec0,    'sample_rec_0/recon')
       dxchange.write_tiff_stack(rec1,    'sample_rec_1/recon')
       dxchange.write_tiff_stack(rec_full,'sample_rec/recon')

   In both cases, use **the same pre-processing options** (ring removal,
   phase retrieval, normalisation) for both sub-reconstructions as for the
   full reconstruction.

   Because ``denoise prepare`` was not used, no config file was written
   automatically.  Create one manually by copying the baseline template::

       (denoise) $ cp /path/to/Noise2Inverse360/baseline_config.yaml \
                  /path/to/sample_rec_config.yaml

   and setting the four path fields to match your directories.

   The ``metadata:`` block (used by the model registry for matching) will
   not be present in a manually created config.  You can add it by hand or
   leave it empty — training will proceed normally either way.

   **Practical example** (APS 2-BM, February 2026 Chawla dataset)::

       # even-indexed projections
       (tomocupy) $ tomocupy recon_steps \
                       --file-name /data3/2BM/2026-02/Chawla/As-cast-Mod2-100mm_115.h5 \
                       --reconstruction-type full \
                       --rotation-axis 1625 \
                       --propagation-distance 100 \
                       --energy 30 \
                       --retrieve-phase-method paganin \
                       --retrieve-phase-alpha 0.0005 \
                       --pixel-size 0.69 \
                       --fbp-filter ramp \
                       --remove-stripe-method fw \
                       --start-proj 0 --proj-step 2 \
                       --out-path-name /data3/2BM/2026-02/Chawla_rec/As-cast-Mod2-100mm_115_rec_0

       # odd-indexed projections
       (tomocupy) $ tomocupy recon_steps \
                       --file-name /data3/2BM/2026-02/Chawla/As-cast-Mod2-100mm_115.h5 \
                       --reconstruction-type full \
                       --rotation-axis 1625 \
                       --propagation-distance 100 \
                       --energy 30 \
                       --retrieve-phase-method paganin \
                       --retrieve-phase-alpha 0.0005 \
                       --pixel-size 0.69 \
                       --fbp-filter ramp \
                       --remove-stripe-method fw \
                       --start-proj 1 --proj-step 2 \
                       --out-path-name /data3/2BM/2026-02/Chawla_rec/As-cast-Mod2-100mm_115_rec_1

   This produces::

       /data3/2BM/2026-02/Chawla_rec/
           As-cast-Mod2-100mm_115_rec/    ← full reconstruction (already exists)
           As-cast-Mod2-100mm_115_rec_0/  ← even-angle sub-reconstruction
           As-cast-Mod2-100mm_115_rec_1/  ← odd-angle sub-reconstruction

Training
========

denoise train
-------------

Train the Noise2Inverse model. ``denoise train`` automatically launches
``torchrun`` with the correct settings — no manual ``torchrun`` invocation
is required.

.. note::

   ``denoise train`` internally sets ``PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1`` to prevent
   user-local packages in ``~/.local/`` from shadowing the conda environment.

Before launching training, ``denoise train`` automatically searches the local
model registry for a model trained under the same instrument conditions and
prompts you with the result.

**Case 1 — a compatible model already exists:**

.. code-block:: text

    # 2.5D (default)
    (denoise) $ denoise train --config /data/sample_rec_config.yaml --gpus 0,1

    # 3D mode
    (denoise) $ denoise train --config /data/sample_rec_config.yaml --gpus 0,1 --mode 3d

    Registry search found 1 matching model(s):
      [1] 2BM_pink_30keV_FLIROryx_22150530  (9/9 criteria match — 100%)
           beamline:            2-BM
           mode:                pink
           energy:              30.0 keV
           type:                GGG:Eu - ESRF
           serial_number:       22150530
           exposure_time:       0.035 s
           binning_x:           2
           binning_y:           2
           registry path:       /home/beams/TOMO/.denoise/registry/2BM_pink_30keV_FLIROryx_22150530
    A compatible model may already exist. Copy the registry path above as --model-dir for slice/volume inference.

    Train a new model anyway? [y/N]

Press **Enter** (or **N**) to cancel and reuse the existing model.
Enter **y** to proceed with a new training run.

**Case 2 — no compatible model found:**

.. code-block:: text

    (denoise) $ denoise train --config /data/sample_rec_config.yaml --gpus 0,1

    Registry search: no matching models found. Existing models:
      - 2BM_pink_30keV_FLIROryx_22150530

    Proceed with new training? [Y/n]

Press **Enter** (or **Y**) to start training.
Enter **n** to cancel and inspect the listed models manually.
If the registry is empty the message reads ``Registry search: registry is empty.``

To skip the registry search entirely, add ``--no-search``::

    (denoise) $ denoise train --config /data/sample_rec_config.yaml --gpus 0,1 --no-search

Running multiple training jobs on the same node
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``torchrun`` binds to port ``29500`` by default.  If you launch a second
training job on the same machine (e.g. two datasets on a 4-GPU node),
the second job will fail with ``EADDRINUSE``.  Use ``--master-port`` to
assign a different port to each job::

    # job 1 — GPUs 0,1, default port
    (denoise) $ denoise train --config /data/delta_config.yaml --gpus 0,1 --no-search

    # job 2 — GPUs 2,3, different port
    (denoise) $ denoise train --config /data/beta_config.yaml --gpus 2,3 --no-search --master-port 29501

``--master-port`` only needs to be set for the second (and subsequent)
jobs; the first job can always use the default.

Launch training with two GPUs::

    (denoise) $ denoise train --config /data/sample_rec_config.yaml --gpus 0,1

For single-GPU training::

    (denoise) $ denoise train --config /data/sample_rec_config.yaml --gpus 0

Any number of GPUs can be used — just list all the IDs. For example, on a
4-GPU machine::

    (denoise) $ denoise train --config /data/sample_rec_config.yaml --gpus 0,1,2,3

``denoise train`` counts the comma-separated IDs and sets ``--nproc_per_node``
accordingly. DDP splits the mini-batch across all GPUs, so doubling the number
of GPUs roughly halves the time per epoch.

.. tip::

   With more GPUs the effective per-GPU batch size is ``mbsz / n_gpus``.
   On a 4-GPU machine consider increasing ``mbsz`` in the config (e.g. 64 or
   128 instead of the default 32) to keep each GPU fully utilised::

       train:
         mbsz: 128

Progress is logged to ``~/logs/denoise_<timestamp>.log`` and printed to the console
with colour-coded levels. Training output (checkpoints, loss curves) is saved to
``<directory_to_reconstructions>/TrainOutput/``.

Three checkpoints are saved independently during training — each updated
in-place whenever a new best is found:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 40 30

   * - File
     - Criterion
     - Recommended use
   * - ``best_val_model.pth``
     - Lowest validation L1 loss
     - **Inference** (best visual quality)
   * - ``best_lcl_model.pth``
     - Lowest LCL regularisation loss
     - Default (conservative)
   * - ``best_edge_model.pth``
     - Highest Laplacian edge score
     - Sharpness-focused comparison

.. note::

   If training is interrupted (e.g. OOM or scheduler walltime), all three
   checkpoints reflect the best values seen up to that point and are fully
   usable for inference. For example, training killed at epoch 1710/2000
   produced ``best_val_model.pth`` at epoch 1705 (val loss 0.053) and
   ``best_edge_model.pth`` at epoch 1650 — both suitable for inference.

What the model learns
---------------------

The Noise2Inverse model learns the **noise statistics of the imaging system**,
not anything about the sample itself.  The model is fully **sample-independent**
and can be reused across datasets as long as the acquisition conditions remain
the same.

The network characterises:

* Detector read noise and dark current
* Shot noise at the specific photon flux (energy × exposure × beam current)
* Scintillator glow and afterglow patterns
* Ring artifact signatures from detector pixel non-uniformity
* Any systematic noise from the lens and optic combination

What does **not** affect reusability:

* Sample composition, density, or size
* Rotation axis position
* Number of projections (within reason)
* Binning (as long as ``psz`` in the config matches the binned pixel size)

When to reuse vs. retrain
--------------------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 25 25

   * - Condition
     - Reuse model?
     - Action
   * - Same beamline, same detector, same energy, same exposure
     - **Yes**
     - Use registry model directly
   * - Same setup, different sample
     - **Yes**
     - Use registry model directly
   * - Same setup, different binning
     - **Yes** (if ``psz`` adjusted)
     - Update ``psz`` in config
   * - Same setup, slightly different exposure (±20%)
     - **Likely yes**
     - Try inference; retrain if quality is poor
   * - Different energy or significantly different flux
     - **No**
     - Retrain on new sub-reconstructions
   * - Different detector or scintillator
     - **No**
     - Retrain on new sub-reconstructions
   * - Different beamline
     - **No**
     - Retrain on new sub-reconstructions

Fine-tuning a pre-trained model
--------------------------------

Instead of training from scratch, you can initialise the network with weights
from a previously trained model and continue training on a new dataset.  This
is useful when acquisition conditions are similar but not identical — fine-tuning
for a fraction of the original epochs may be sufficient:

.. code-block:: bash

    # fine-tune from a registry entry
    (denoise) $ denoise train \
                    --config /data/new_sample_config.yaml \
                    --gpus 0,1,2,3 \
                    --finetune ~/.denoise/registry/2BM_pink_30keV_FLIROryx_22150530 \
                    --no-search

    # fine-tune from a specific .pth file
    (denoise) $ denoise train \
                    --config /data/new_sample_config.yaml \
                    --gpus 0,1,2,3 \
                    --finetune /data/brain_beta/TrainOutput/best_val_model.pth \
                    --no-search

``--finetune`` loads **model weights only** — all training state (epoch,
loss history, best values) resets from scratch.  When a registry directory is
given, ``best_val_model.pth`` is used automatically.

.. note::

   ``--finetune`` and ``--resume`` are mutually exclusive.

Resuming interrupted training
-----------------------------

Every epoch, ``denoise train`` writes a ``resume.pth`` checkpoint to
``TrainOutput/`` that captures the complete training state: model weights,
optimiser state (Adam momentum), epoch counter, ``model_updates``, all best
values, and the full loss history.  If training is interrupted for any reason,
restart from the last completed epoch with ``--resume``::

    (denoise) $ denoise train --config /data/sample_rec_config.yaml --gpus 0,1 --resume

Training continues from epoch ``N+1`` where ``N`` is the last fully completed
epoch.  All three best-model checkpoints are preserved and usable for inference
at any point.

.. note::

   ``resume.pth`` is overwritten at the end of every epoch.  It is safe to
   run ``denoise slice`` or ``denoise volume`` while training is in progress —
   the inference commands load the *best* checkpoints, not ``resume.pth``.

.. warning::

   Do **not** use ``--resume`` after changing the config (e.g. ``psz``,
   ``n_slices``).  You may safely increase ``maxep`` to extend training beyond
   the original limit.

Reducing training slices with z_stride
---------------------------------------

By default, all slices from the sub-reconstructions are loaded into RAM for
training.  For large CT datasets, adjacent slices are highly correlated along Z,
so using every slice is rarely necessary.  Set ``z_stride`` in the config to
load only every Nth slice.  This works in **both 2.5D and 3D modes**.

.. code-block:: yaml

    train:
      psz: 256
      n_slices: 5
      mbsz: 32
      lr: 0.001
      warmup: 2000
      maxep: 2000
      z_stride: 5   # use every 5th slice — 5× less RAM and 5× faster load

``z_stride: 1`` (the default) loads every slice.  A value of 5 is a good
starting point for brain-sized datasets (~2000 slices): it retains full
anatomical coverage while reducing load time and memory by ~5×.

The ``warmup`` threshold is automatically divided by ``z_stride`` so that the
number of warmup model updates stays proportional to the effective dataset size
— no manual adjustment needed.

.. admonition:: 3D mode — RAM impact

   In 3D mode each DDP rank loads the **entire volume** independently, so RAM
   scales as ``world_size × dataset_size``.  ``z_stride`` is especially
   important here.  For a 1852-slice volume with two GPUs:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 15 20 25 20 20

      * - z_stride
        - Slices loaded
        - RAM per rank
        - Total (2 ranks)
        - Load time
      * - 1 (default)
        - 1852
        - ~430 GB
        - ~860 GB
        - ~14 min
      * - 5
        - 370
        - ~86 GB
        - ~172 GB
        - ~3 min
      * - 10
        - 185
        - ~43 GB
        - ~86 GB
        - ~90 s

   The maximum useful ``z_stride`` is ``floor(D / psz_3d)`` — you must
   load at least ``psz_3d`` slices to draw a cubic training patch.

.. note::

   Do **not** use ``--resume`` after changing ``z_stride`` in the config —
   the dataset size changes, which affects the epoch/update relationship.

Early stopping
--------------

By default, training runs for ``maxep`` epochs regardless of convergence.
To stop automatically when the validation loss stops improving, add a
``patience`` key to the ``train`` section of the config:

.. code-block:: yaml

    train:
      psz: 256
      n_slices: 5
      mbsz: 32
      lr: 0.001
      warmup: 2000
      maxep: 2000
      patience: 200   # stop if val loss does not improve for 200 consecutive epochs

``patience: 0`` (the default) disables early stopping.  The counter resets
each time a new best validation loss is found and only starts after warmup
completes.  The state is saved in ``resume.pth`` so it is preserved across
``--resume`` restarts.

3D mode configuration
---------------------

When ``--mode 3d`` is passed to ``denoise train``, the following
YAML parameters control 3D training (``denoise prepare`` always writes
both 2.5D and 3D fields so no manual editing is required):

.. code-block:: yaml

    dataset:
      directory_to_reconstructions: /data/sample_rec
      sub_recon_name0: sample_rec_0
      sub_recon_name1: sample_rec_1
      full_recon_name: sample_rec

    train:
      psz: 256          # 2.5D patch size (ignored in 3D mode)
      psz_3d: 96        # 3D cubic patch size — must be divisible by 2**n_blocks_3d
      n_slices: 5       # 2.5D stack depth (ignored in 3D mode)
      nb_patches_3d: 17600  # number of random 3D patches per epoch
      n_blocks_3d: 4    # U-Net encoder depth (matches SSD_3D reference)
      start_filts_3d: 56  # filter count of first encoder block
      mbsz: 4           # batch size — 3D patches are large; use 2–8 per GPU
      z_stride: 10      # load every 10th slice — critical for large volumes
      lr: 0.001
      warmup: 2000
      maxep: 2000
      patience: 0
      mode: '3d'        # saved automatically; read by slice/volume commands

    infer:
      overlap: 0.5      # patch overlap fraction for 3D sliding window
      window: hann      # blending window (hann recommended for 3D)

Key differences from 2.5D config:

* ``psz_3d`` replaces ``psz`` for 3D patch size.  Must be divisible by
  ``2**n_blocks_3d`` (e.g. 96 for 4 blocks since 96 / 16 = 6).
* ``mbsz`` should be much smaller than in 2.5D — a 96³ patch at fp32 is ~3.4 MB,
  so 4–8 fit comfortably on a 40 GB GPU alongside the model.
* ``nb_patches_3d`` sets how many random cubic patches are sampled per epoch.
  17600 matches the SSD_3D reference; reduce for quick experiments or smaller
  volumes.
* ``z_stride`` is especially important in 3D mode — each rank loads the full
  volume independently, so RAM scales as ``world_size × dataset_size``.
  Use ``z_stride: 10`` as a starting point for large volumes (>1000 slices).

.. tip::

   The defaults written by ``denoise prepare`` (``psz_3d: 96``,
   ``n_blocks_3d: 4``, ``start_filts_3d: 56``, ``mbsz: 4``) match the SSD_3D
   reference and are the recommended starting point.  Reduce ``psz_3d`` to 64
   (with ``n_blocks_3d: 3``) if GPU memory is tight.

Inference
=========

denoise slice (2.5D only)
-------------------------

.. note::

   ``denoise slice`` is only available in **2.5D mode**.  In 3D mode, use
   ``denoise volume`` instead (single-slice inference is not meaningful for
   a model trained on cubic patches).

.. tip::

   ``denoise slice`` can be run while training is still in progress.
   The model checkpoints in ``TrainOutput/`` are updated in-place whenever a
   new best is found, so you can check denoising quality at any point without
   waiting for training to finish.

Denoise a single CT slice::

    (denoise) $ denoise slice --config /data/sample_rec_config.yaml --slice-number 500
    2025-01-01 10:00:00,000 - Loading slice 500
    2025-01-01 10:00:05,000 - Saved denoised slice to .../sample_denoised_slices/00500.tiff

The denoised slice is saved as a TIFF in
``<directory_to_reconstructions>/<full_recon_name without _rec>_denoised_slices/``.

By default the model is loaded from ``<directory_to_reconstructions>/TrainOutput/``.
To use a registered model instead, pass ``--model-dir``::

    (denoise) $ denoise slice \
                    --config /data/sample_rec_config.yaml \
                    --slice-number 500 \
                    --checkpoint val \
                    --model-dir ~/.denoise/registry/2BM_pink_30keV_FLIROryx_22150530_brain_beta_z5

::

    (denoise) $ denoise slice -h
    usage: denoise slice [-h] --config FILE [--gpus IDS] --slice-number N [--checkpoint {val,lcl,edge}] [--model-dir DIR]

    Denoise a single CT slice

    options:
      -h, --help                    show this help message and exit
      --config FILE                 Path to the YAML configuration file
      --gpus IDS                    Comma-separated list of visible GPU IDs (default: 0)
      --slice-number N              Index of the CT slice to denoise
      --checkpoint {val,lcl,edge}   Checkpoint to use (default: lcl)
      --model-dir DIR               Directory containing model checkpoints (default: TrainOutput/)

denoise volume
--------------

.. note::

   The GPU batch size for inference is determined automatically by profiling the
   model against the configured patch size (``psz``) and the available GPU
   memory. On a modern GPU (e.g. A100 80 GB) the batch size will be maximised
   to saturate the GPU. For large volumes the initial RAM load (reading all TIFF
   files from disk) typically takes longer than the GPU inference itself.

Denoise the entire CT volume::

    # 2.5D (default — or when mode is already stored in the config YAML)
    (denoise) $ denoise volume --config /data/sample_rec_config.yaml

    # 3D
    (denoise) $ denoise volume --config /data/sample_rec_config.yaml --mode 3d
    2025-01-01 10:00:00,000 - Loading data into CPU memory, it will take a while ...
    2025-01-01 10:00:30,000 - Loaded 1000 slices of size 2048x2048
    2025-01-01 10:00:30,100 - Patch volume size: 65536x256x256
    2025-01-01 10:00:30,200 - Processing data ...
    ...
    2025-01-01 10:05:00,000 - Stitching denoised data ...
    2025-01-01 10:05:10,000 - Saving data to .../sample_denoised_volume ...
    2025-01-01 10:05:30,000 - Done.

To denoise only a sub-volume (slices 200 to 400)::

    (denoise) $ denoise volume --config /data/sample_rec_config.yaml --start-slice 200 --end-slice 400

The denoised volume is saved as individual TIFF files in
``<directory_to_reconstructions>/<full_recon_name without _rec>_denoised_volume_<mode>/``
(e.g. ``delta_all_denoised_volume_2.5d/`` or ``delta_all_denoised_volume_3d/``).
This means results from both modes coexist in the same reconstruction directory
without overwriting each other.

::

    (denoise) $ denoise volume -h
    usage: denoise volume [-h] --config FILE [--gpus IDS] [--start-slice N] [--end-slice N] [--checkpoint {val,lcl,edge}] [--model-dir DIR]

    Denoise the entire CT volume

    options:
      -h, --help                    show this help message and exit
      --config FILE                 Path to the YAML configuration file
      --gpus IDS                    Comma-separated list of visible GPU IDs (default: 0)
      --start-slice N               Start slice index (default: first slice)
      --end-slice N                 End slice index (default: last slice)
      --mode MODE                   Convolution mode: 2.5d (default) or 3d
      --checkpoint {val,lcl,edge}   Checkpoint to use (default: lcl)

Performance example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The table below shows measured wall-clock times for a real APS 2-BM dataset:

* **Volume**: 2426 slices × 3232 × 3232 voxels (~100 GB in RAM)
* **Training hardware**: 2× NVIDIA V100 32 GB
* **Inference hardware**: 1× NVIDIA A100 80 GB (batch size 512, auto-selected)

Two inference runs are shown — one with ``--checkpoint lcl`` (default) and one
with ``--checkpoint val`` — to illustrate that checkpoint choice does not affect
throughput: the model architecture is identical, only the weights differ.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 18 18

   * - Stage
     - ``--checkpoint lcl``
     - ``--checkpoint val``
   * - Training (1710/2000 epochs, killed by SIGKILL at ~85%)
     - 42 h 23 min
     - —
   * - Load + normalize TIFFs into RAM
     - 5 min 59 s
     - 4 min 23 s
   * - Pre-pad + build patch index
     - 17 s
     - 18 s
   * - GPU inference (2962 batches × 512 patches)
     - 41 min 45 s
     - 41 min 13 s
   * - Stitch patches → volume
     - 11 min 16 s
     - 16 min 58 s
   * - Save 2426 TIFFs to disk
     - 7 min 27 s
     - 7 min 41 s
   * - **Total inference**
     - **~67 min**
     - **~71 min**

GPU inference (~41 min, 60–62% of total) is stable across runs. Loading
variation reflects OS disk-cache state. Stitching variation (~11–17 min) is
due to system memory pressure. Training time dwarfs inference by ~38×; using
4 GPUs would reduce training to roughly 10–12 hours.

Model Registry
==============

``denoise`` includes a local model registry so that trained models can be
stored, searched, and reused without manual bookkeeping.  Models are stored
in ``~/.denoise/registry/`` (override with the ``DENOISE_REGISTRY``
environment variable).  Because tocai and tomo4 share the same home directory
over GPFS, a model registered on tocai is immediately available on tomo4.

.. note::

   The registry lives entirely in your home directory and is **never** tracked
   by git.

Instrument metadata in the config
----------------------------------

When ``denoise prepare`` is run with ``--file-name``, it reads key instrument
parameters directly from the raw HDF5 file and writes them into the
``metadata:`` block of the generated config YAML::

    metadata:
      start_date: '2026-02-19T09:02:27-0600'
      name: Chawla
      beamline: 2-BM
      current: 200.03 mA
      energy: 30.0 keV
      mode: pink
      type: GGG:Eu - ESRF
      active_thickness: 17.0 um
      magnification: 9.835
      resolution: 0.7015 um
      manufacturer: FLIR
      model: Oryx ORX-10G-310S9M
      serial_number: 22150530
      exposure_time: 0.035 s
      temperature: 25.3 C
      binning_x: 2
      binning_y: 2
      propagation_distance: 100.0 mm

This block is the basis for all registry matching.  The fields used to decide
whether two configs share the same noise fingerprint are:

``beamline``, ``mode``, ``energy``, ``type`` (scintillator),
``active_thickness``, ``serial_number``, ``exposure_time``,
``binning_x``, ``binning_y``, and ``temperature`` (when present in both).

``propagation_distance``, ``magnification``, ``current``, and experimenter
fields are recorded for provenance but are not used in matching.

Registering a trained model
----------------------------

After training is complete, register the model with its config::

    (denoise) $ denoise register \
                    --config /data/sample_rec_config.yaml \
                    --model-dir /data/sample_rec/TrainOutput

An entry is created automatically under a name derived from the metadata
(e.g. ``2BM_pink_30keV_22150530_35ms_20260219_143000``).  To use a
custom name::

    (denoise) $ denoise register \
                    --config /data/sample_rec_config.yaml \
                    --model-dir /data/sample_rec/TrainOutput \
                    --name 2BM_pink_30keV_FLIROryx

The registry entry contains a copy of the config and all three checkpoint
files (``best_val_model.pth``, ``best_lcl_model.pth``,
``best_edge_model.pth``).

::

    (denoise) $ denoise register -h
    usage: denoise register [-h] --config FILE --model-dir DIR [--name NAME]

    Register a trained model in the local registry for later reuse.

    options:
      -h, --help        show this help message and exit
      --config FILE     Path to the YAML configuration file used for training
      --model-dir DIR   Directory containing the trained checkpoints (TrainOutput/)
      --name NAME       Registry entry name (auto-generated from metadata if omitted)

Searching the registry
-----------------------

To manually search the registry for models compatible with a given config::

    (denoise) $ denoise search --config /data/new_sample_rec_config.yaml

Example output::

    Registry search found 1 matching model(s):
      [1] 2BM_pink_30keV_FLIROryx_20260219_143000  (9/9 criteria match — 100%)
           beamline:            2-BM
           mode:                pink
           energy:              30.0 keV
           type:                GGG:Eu - ESRF
           serial_number:       22150530
           exposure_time:       0.035 s
           binning_x:           2
           binning_y:           2
           registry path:       /home/user/.denoise/registry/2BM_pink_30keV_FLIROryx_20260219_143000

::

    (denoise) $ denoise search -h
    usage: denoise search [-h] --config FILE

    Search the registry for models trained under compatible instrument conditions.

    options:
      -h, --help     show this help message and exit
      --config FILE  Path to the YAML configuration file to match against

Using a registered model for inference
----------------------------------------

When ``denoise train`` finds a matching model and you cancel training, create a
new config for the new dataset (via ``denoise prepare``) and add the
normalisation statistics from the registered model's ``config.yaml``::

    dataset:
      directory_to_reconstructions: /data/new_experiment
      sub_recon_name0: new_sample_rec_0
      sub_recon_name1: new_sample_rec_1
      full_recon_name: new_sample_rec
      mean4norm: 0.1234    # ← from the registered model's config.yaml
      std4norm:  0.0567    # ← from the registered model's config.yaml

Then run inference directly::

    (denoise) $ denoise volume \
                    --config /data/new_sample_rec_config.yaml \
                    --checkpoint val

.. note::

   ``mean4norm`` and ``std4norm`` are written by the training script and handle
   intensity normalisation.  They must match the values used during training —
   copy them from the registered model's ``config.yaml``.
